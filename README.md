# utils

Common Rust code used in several projects.

This is a collection of random things used in a few places. All of the code here should ultimately be upstreamed in anothr crate, or split into a proper crate. It's not easy to do that, and in the meantime, copies of this code are spreading, so at least as a first step, deduplicating here.

Also includes some unmerged georust PRs, <https://github.com/georust/geo/pull/935> and <https://github.com/georust/geo/pull/1050>, both by <https://github.com/thehappycheese>. Although they're not yet upstreamed, they're perfectly useful to many projects!
